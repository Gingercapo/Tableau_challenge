I want to answer this question, 
- which region made at least 13,000 profit in the home office segment? To answer this, you're going to need to do these tasks. First, you're going to need to build a bar chart showing the sales by region and segment. Next, you're going to color the sales bar to show the amount of profit. Then, you'll need to create two filters, one for segment and one for profit, and finally, answer the question, which region made 13,000 profit in the home office segment? This challenge should take you about five minutes.
